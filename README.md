## Introduction to Performance Benchmarking
This practical focuses on benchmarking manual implementations against built-in MATLAB/Octave functions. Through hands-on exercises, you will learn how to measure and compare the performance of different algorithmic approaches, understand optimization techniques, and develop profiling skills essential for high-performance computing.

## Repository Structure
This folder contains the materials for **Practical 1: Introduction to Performance Benchmarking**. The contents include:
- **Practical Manual**: Detailed instructions and background theory
- **Tutorial**: Step-by-step walkthrough of benchmarking techniques
- **Skeleton Code**: Starter code for implementing and benchmarking algorithms

## Learning Objectives
By completing this practical, you will be able to:
- Measure execution time and performance of algorithms using MATLAB/Octave timing functions
- Compare manual implementations with built-in functions
- Identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Create meaningful benchmarks and interpret results
- Understand trade-offs between code simplicity and performance
